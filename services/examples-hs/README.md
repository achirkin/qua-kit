# Haskell Luci/Helen service examples

Example code to run qua-kit services in different execution modes.

To build the service, use haskell [`stack`](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html) tool:
```
stack install --install-ghc
```
To use it, just run a compiled executable `hs-example-service`.
Output of build command above will give a hint where the file is placed.
