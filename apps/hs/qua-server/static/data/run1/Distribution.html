  Density can be defined as the mass of an object per unit area. In architecture and urban planning, physical density is a numerical measure of the concentration of individuals or physical structures within a given unit area. It can be used as a spatial indicator in geographical context <sup><a href="#distribution_cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>.

  In urban planning, measurement of physical density can be broadly divided into two categories: people density and building density. People density is expressed as the number of people or household per given area, while building density is defined as the ratio of building structures to an area unit <sup><a href="#distribution_cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>.
  Building density most be related with urban morphology because it plays an important role in the shaping of urban form. For instance, different combinations of plot ratio and site coverage will manifest into a variety of different built forms <sup>[<a href="#distribution_cite_ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#distribution_cite_ref-2">2</a>]</sup>.

  In regards to rapid urbanization, the relationship between building density and urban form has become an important field of study. Mathematical, geometrical and cognitive analyses have been conducted to address the issue, particularly concerning the relationships between building heights, plot ratio, site coverage and solar obstruction <sup>[<a href="#distribution_cite_ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#distribution_cite_ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#distribution_cite_ref-5">5</a>]</sup>.

  When planning new building densities, the correspondent properties are linked to the design objectives for the specific urban area. For instance, the efficient use of space with limited interstitial spaces, the daylight access of buildings, or an appropriate response to existing site geometries.

  For our MOOC exercise you can intuitively work with centrality or you can deepen your knowledge on Space Syntax theory or graph theory and use computational tools such as depthmap (http://www.spacesyntax.net/software/) or any GIS software.
