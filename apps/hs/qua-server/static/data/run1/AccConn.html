  The concept of accessibility is a key element in urban, regional and transportation  planning <sup><a href="#accconn_cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>. Accessibility can be defined as the facility in which one place can be reached from another place and is dependent on the spatial distributions the given location. Accessibility is also attributed to the quality and character of the activities in a location, the efficiency of the transportation system, and the characteristics of the pedestrian <sup><a href="#accconn_cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>. People's choice of living might depends on the level of accessibility to work, shopping and public service.

  Connectivity is directly related to accessibility. Connectivity analysis is based on graph theory. A connected graph is a graph that has a path between every pair of vertices <sup><a href="#accconn_cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>. For urban networks, connectivity is used to understand spatial conditions affecting pedestrian activities and behaviors in cities.

  Space Syntax brings together a series of theories for the analysis of spatial configurations in urban systems <sup><a href="#accconn_cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#accconn_cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>. The Space Syntax approach represents streets as nodes and intersections as edges. According to Space Syntax, the three main conceptions of space are: isovist, axial space and convex space, and the street networks analyses are:  Integration, Choice and Depth Distance. 
</p>

  Integration measures how to reach a street segment from all other street segments in a network using shortest paths. From a theoretical perspective, integration might show how complex it is for pedestrians to reach a street and can "predict" accessibility. Another Space Syntax technique that can be use to analyse accessibility is Choice. Choice measures the shortest path between 2 elements (spatial accessibility).

  In city planning and design, the concepts of accessibility and connectivity are use when, for instance, creating a clear public space hierarchy in terms of streets, when enhancing private household access to public space, or giving permeability and connections to existing street networks.

  For our MOOC exercise you can intuitively work with accessibility or you can deepen your knowledge on Space Syntax theory or graph theory and use computational tools such as depthmap <a href="http://www.spacesyntax.net/software/">depthmap</a> or any GIS software.
