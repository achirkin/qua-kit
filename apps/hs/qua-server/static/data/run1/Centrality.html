  Centrality analysis is based on graph theory and is used to understand structural properties of complex relational networks.
  Centrality measures identify that, in a network, some nodes are more central than others (the most important vertices in a graph).
  The idea of centrality was first introduced in the context of social systems.
  It helps understand the relation between the location of an individual in the network and its influence in the group<sup><a href="#centrality_cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>.
  Centrality is also relevant for urban networks and used to understand spatial factors affecting human life and behaviors in cities<sup><a href="#centrality_cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>
  In the city we consider urban street patterns as spatial networks by transforming the city into a spatial graph by mapping
    the inter-sections into the graph nodes and the roads into links between nodes.
  By using a set of different centrality indices (multiple centrality assessment) it is possible to spot relevant places of a city:

      <li>
        Closeness centrality: places closer to other places.
      </li>
      <li>
        Betweenness centrality: places that are structurally made to be crossed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Straightness centrality: places whose route to other places deviates less from the virtual straight route.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information centrality: places whose deactivation affects the structural properties of the system.<sup><a href="#centrality_cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>
      </li>

  Space Syntax brings together a series of theories for the analysis of spatial configurations in urban systems <sup><a href="#centrality_cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#centrality_cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>.
  The Space Syntax approach represents streets as nodes and intersections as edges.
  According to Space Syntax, the three main conceptions of space are: isovist, axial space and convex space, and the street networks analyses are:  Integration, Choice and Depth Distance.

  From the urban design perspective, planners and designers use the concept of centrality, for instance, when giving a clear public space hierarchy, when creating public open spaces, or to concentrate main activities in a central place.

  For our MOOC exercise you can intuitively work with centrality or you can deepen your knowledge on Space Syntax theory or graph theory and use computational tools such as depthmap (http://www.spacesyntax.net/software/) or any GIS software.
