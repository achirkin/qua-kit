  Visibility analysis shows the visual impact from a point into the surrounding environment affected by the obstructions and shaping the skyline. In the city, the urban elements such as topography, building, trees, etc., make part of the urban atmospheric visibility. The quality of an urban space is affected by how people perceive the space. For instance, people feel more secure in spaces where they can easily see the surroundings from different positions.

  Space Syntax brings together a series of theories for the analysis of spatial configurations in urban systems <sup><a href="#visibility_cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#visibility_cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>. The Space Syntax approach represents streets as nodes and intersections as edges. According to Space Syntax, the three main conceptions of space are: isovist, axial space and convex space, and the street networks analyses are:  Integration, Choice and Depth Distance.

  Isovist is the field of view from any particular point. An isovist, or viewshed, is the area in a spatial environment directly visible from a location within the space <sup><a href="#visibility_cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>. Isovists have particular relevance to architectural and urban analysis by providing an intuitively way of analyzing the spatial environment from the point of view of individuals.

  For our MOOC exercise you can intuitively work with visibility or you can deepen your knowledge on Space Syntax theory or graph theory and use computational tools such as
  <a href="http://www.spacesyntax.net/software/">depthmap</a> or any GIS software.
