  Connectivity analysis is based on graph theory. A connected graph is an undirected graph that has a path between every pair of vertices<sup><a href="#connectivity_cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>. For urban networks, connectivity is used to understand spatial conditions affecting pedestrian activities and behaviors in cities.

  Space Syntax brings together a series of theories for the analysis of spatial configurations in urban systems <sup><a href="#connectivity_cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#connectivity_cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>. The Space Syntax approach represents streets as nodes and intersections as edges. According to Space Syntax, the three main conceptions of space are: isovist, axial space and convex space, and the street networks analyses are:  Integration, Choice and Depth Distance.

  In Space Syntax connectivity is a local property: it tells you how many elements (e.g. convex spaces) are directly connected with one certain element. A local property can be experienced directly from a static location in space. Depth Distance is a global property: it tells you how "far away" an element is from all the other elements. A global property can only be experienced from moving through space.

  For our MOOC exercise you can intuitively work with connectivity or you can deepen your knowledge on Space Syntax theory or graph theory and use computational tools such as
  <a href="http://www.spacesyntax.net/software/">depthmap</a> or any GIS software.
