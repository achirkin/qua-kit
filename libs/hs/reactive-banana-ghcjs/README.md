# reactive-banana-ghcjs

GHCJS bindings to reactive-banana.

The package provides minimalistic interface for two cases:

  1) Simple click events on html elements;
  2) Low-level window-like behavior of an element (e.g. canvas) with pointer events and render loop.

The library is closure-compiler advanced-optimizations-friendly.
